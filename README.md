# Vacation-Planner
Vacations in the United States have often been defined by one of its best features- the American Landscape. 

Families across America have made National Parks a cornerstone of their vacations for decades and we have created a website to make the planning process a little bit easier. 

We have created a site that allows you to view weather forecasts, campground information, and alerts all in one place. Now, you can spend less time navigating the web and more time enjoying the great outdoors.
